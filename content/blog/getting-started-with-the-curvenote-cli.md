## Curvenote is on PyPi üêç

We recently published a python client library and command line interface on pypi .

Find it at: <https://pypi.org/project/curvenote/>

```{figure} images/DOHMeg040aVXqR51yjBy-whc7KFWpINYGFQS0eURD-v1.png
:name: 85d242e1
```

This equips python coders with some wide ranging API access capabilities that we will continue to extend.

The CLI also allows anyone comfortable on the command line to run a small set of queries, which we‚Äôll also be extending as we develop further.

To get started with the cli and/or client, create your virtual environment as usual and install using `pip`.
```
$ mkdir working
$ cd working
$ python -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
(env)$ python -m pip install curvenote
(env)$ python -m curvenote --version
Curvenote CLI Version 0.0.10
```

## API Access

Right now there is now way to get a long lived API key from Curvenote (Coming Soon!) but we can get a daily API key from your browser. It‚Äôs a little involved if you are not used to peeking inside of your browser tools, so i‚Äôve recorded a short video to show how.

## Downloading Latex

One of the most useful CLI functions right now is the `pull-as-latex` command which let‚Äôs you download any article as a local LaTeX project which you can tweak and build locally.
